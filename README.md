ShibbolethECPAuthClient
=======================

A Shibboleth ECP authentication client that also exposes access to the SAML response received from the IdP. 
  Currently this client requires a URL protected by a Shibboleth Service Provider to initiate a Shibboleth
  conversation. This might be changed in the future.
